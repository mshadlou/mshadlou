# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an effective learner, quickly adapdable, teamworker, lover of creativity/novelty, software engineer, and researcher.<br> 
Here I share the codes I developed for my publications, workes I did for clients as a software engineering consultant [clearly not whole works, just parts to share the experiences only], and the teaching courses I delivered so far.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm doing now as a software engineer
I am doing full-time software engineering at the moment using C# and .NET for the next generation of high-speed data acquisition systems compatible with industry 4.0 specifications. Site investigation using CPT/CPTu/SPT/SCPT/WISON has a lot of complexities and existing software in the market can not tackle all complexities because uncertainty is a lot. Hence the software, I have done the architectural design with well-defined interfaces and am implementing now, is able to find the source of errors and correct the data in real-time. As a result, post-processing, which normally takes several days, is removed. I'm taking lots of features into account for example reducing the time of calibration, providing multi-sensory experiences up to 1000 channels (sensors), etc. TODO list is to include computational methods involved to check the safety factors and carry out soil classification in real-time. To ensure a stable codebase at all times, I have developed an emulator for testing the software. Continuous delivery and deployment have also been integrated by constructing an Azure DevOps Services pipeline using Azure Pipelines. I can't share more about this software as I have signed an NDA. The above is just public info.<br>

Simultaneously, as a consultant, I'm developing a new outdoor positioning system which does not rely on GPS/GNSS data anymore! I'm sure you are thinking now, how comes! It's true and possible so I wish I can share more in future. I have finished the architecture design and implementation is in progress using embedded C/C++<br>

## ðŸŒ± What I'm doing now as a researcher
In terms of my research interests, I'm looking forward to collaborating more with seniors for publications on geotechnical, structural and earthquake engineeing.
