# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an effective learner, quickly adapdable, teamworker, lover of creativity/novelty, software engineer, and researcher.<br> 
Here I share the codes I developed for my publications, workes I did for clients as a software engineering consultant [clearly not whole works, just parts to share the experiences only], and the teaching courses I delivered so far.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm doing now as a software engineer
I am doing full-time software engineering at the moment using C# and .NET for the next generation of high-speed data acquisition systems compatible with industry 4.0 specifications. Site investigation using CPT/CPTu/SPT/SCPT/WISON has a lot of complexities and existing software in the market can not tackle all complexities because uncertainty is a lot. Hence the software, I have done the architectural design with well-defined interfaces and am implementing now, is able to make site investigation easier and quicker. Continuous delivery and deployment have also been integrated by constructing an Azure DevOps Services pipeline using Azure Pipelines.<br>

## ðŸŒ± What I'm doing now as a researcher
In terms of my research interests, I'm looking forward to collaborating more with seniors for publications on geotechnical, structural and earthquake engineeing.
